## About the prject
This project was built to help GUC students organize due dates of their quiz, assignments, exams and etc... by reading the data from the announcement section of the Content Management System (CMS) of GUC

## The Following technologies were used:
 - llama3-70b-8192 api, which is an api that allows us to make use of the llama-3  ai model that taked 70B paramters
 - Puppeteer framework, allows webscrapping and extracting data from the announcement section and login automation to the cms
 - React.js
 - Express.js
 - Tailwind CSS

##  Important note:
The project is not fully functioning because of the following hurdles:
  - not all the professors write full announcements on the CMS and rather announce in the lecture itself, so data is not thoroughly extracted.
  - the ai model has limits to the tokens it takes as an input and gives as an output which sometimes affects the analyzed data and make it not thoroughly analyzed.
    
Because of these problems the project was not published to avoid inconvenice.
